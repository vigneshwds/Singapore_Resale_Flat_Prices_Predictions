A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and RandomForest algorithm to predicting the Resale Flat prices in Singapore.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model is based on historical data of resale flat transactions and is designed to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

## Features
- Data Exploration and Cleaning: Identify and rectify skewness and outliers in the dataset.
- Regression Analysis: Predict Selling_Price using a robust regression model.
- Streamlit Dashboard: Interactive web app for real-time data exploration and prediction.
